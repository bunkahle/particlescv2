particlescv2
============

particlescv2 is a port of the Particles Python PyGame library PyIgniton for
OpenCV2. The original PyIgntion files can be found at 
`https://launchpad.net/pyignition <https://launchpad.net/pyignition>`_. 
Setup the library by running setup_cython.py::

    setup_cython.py build_ext --inplace

This will generate a compiled cythonized particlescv2.pyd (Windows) or particlescv2.so (Linux, Mac)
from the file particlescv2.pyx. This is useful for speed and performance.
particlescv2 seems to be even faster than the original PyGame library PyIgnition.

The library is pretty fast even if it is not compiled. The plain Python 
routine can be found in particlescv2.py. 

Binary for Win-32 Python27
==========================
For convenience there is also the precompiled binary for Win-32 Python 2.7
included: particlescv2.pyd. Copy this file to Lib/site-packages directory
and you are ready to go::

    import particlescv2
    ... your code

Examples
========
There are several examples for running the library in the Examples section.

Requirements
============
The blist is required for running as well as numpy and opencv2.
These libraries can easily be installed with
pip install numpy
pip install blist
pip install opencv-python

opencv2 and numpy windows binaries and setup wheels can also be downloaded from
Christoph Gohlkes Python page for windows:
